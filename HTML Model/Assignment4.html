    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  My name is Rajesh, and I have around 1 year and 3 months of experience, including a 6-month internship and 9 months as an Associate Database Engineer at MyDBOPS. During this time, I worked mainly with SQL and database optimization, which gave me a strong foundation in problem-solving and performance tuning. <br></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am skilled in Java, SQL, and C#, and I’ve built projects like a Taxi Booking System, an Expense Tracking System, and a To-Do List app with Java backend and MySQL. These projects helped me strengthen my backend logic, database integration, and problem-solving skills. Recently, I’ve also been improving my knowledge in frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)  to broaden my technical expertise. <br></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Currently, I’m preparing for interviews with a focus on data structures, algorithms, and system design, and I’m very interested in applying my skills to solve real-world challenges at Zoho, especially because I admire the company’s product-driven culture and focus on end-to-end development. <br></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new technologies and improving my coding skills through platforms like LeetCode.</p>
